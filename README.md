Building
---

### Update your Ubuntu machine.

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```
### Install the required dependencies.

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libssl1.0-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils python3 curl libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-all-dev libboost-program-options-dev libminiupnpc-dev libzmq3-dev libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libqrencode-dev unzip libgmp3-dev
```

### Install Berkeley DB.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
```
```
sudo apt-get update
```
```
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev
```

### Build Linux/MAC

Ensure you have successfully installed all system package dependencies as described above. Then run the build, e.g.:
```
git clone https://github.com/realcoin-rea/rea.git
```
```
chmod -R +x rea/
```
```
cd rea
```
```
./autogen.sh
```
```
./configure --with-incompatible-bdb
```
```
make -j12
```

This should compile our dependencies and build `realcoind`
